# alien_invasion

This project comes from the 'Python Crash Course' book by Eric Matthes.

There's not much to explain, you take control of a Ship and shoot down Aliens that keep getting closer to you.
If you're hit, you lose one of three lifes you have; if you succeed in shooting all Aliens down you proceed to the next level and the difficulty increases.

The game also has a Score and High Score system to keep track of how well you've done.

I've done this project because I found making 2d games with Python quite interesting, but after I was done I learned that it's...different and not my cup of tea.

To start the game you'll just have to rune the 'game.py' file and you're all set.
